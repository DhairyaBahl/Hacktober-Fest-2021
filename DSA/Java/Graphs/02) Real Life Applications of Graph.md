# Real Life Applications of Graph
>Graphs are used to represent many real-life applications: Graphs are used to represent **`networks`**. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit 
>network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook. For example, in Facebook, each person is represented with a vertex(or node). Each node is a structure 
>and contains information like person id, name, gender, and locale.
>
> * **`Google maps`** uses graphs for building transportation systems, where intersection of two(or more) roads are considered to be a vertex and the road connecting two vertices 
> is considered to be an edge, thus their navigation system is based on the algorithm to calculate the shortest path between two vertices.
> * In **`Facebook`**, users are considered to be the vertices and if they are friends then there is an edge running between them. Facebookâ€™s Friend suggestion algorithm uses 
> graph theory. Facebook is an example of **`Undirected graph`**.
> * In **`World Wide Web`**, web pages are considered to be the vertices. There is an edge from a page u to other page v if there is a link of page v on page u. This is an 
> example of **`Directed graph`**. It was the basic idea behind Google Page Ranking Algorithm.
> * In **`Operating System`**, we come across the Resource Allocation Graph where each process and resources are considered to be vertices. Edges are drawn from resources to the 
> allocated process, or from requesting process to the requested resource. If this leads to any formation of a cycle then a deadlock will occur.
